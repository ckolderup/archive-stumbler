        <p>
          I made this to make it easier to look through collections of stuff on the internet archive a little bit more serendipitously.
          If you run into an error message, you may have hit an edge case. If you reload the page it may work with a freshly generated random number,
          but if you keep having problems you can always <a href="mailto:casey+archive-stumbler@kolderup.org">email me</a> with the specifics of the
          URL you were trying to reach and the error message you got and if I have time, I will take a look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note for people browsing large collections: due to a limitation with how I'm fetching data from archive.org ("as lazily as possible"), only
          the first ten thousand items in a given collection are able to be returned. Sorry! Anything more than that and I'd have to actually pull down
          and store archive.org data and I'm not really interested in the work that would involve.
        </p>

      this is a thing by casey. <a href="https://archive-stumbler.glitch.me">go back home</a> or <a href="https://glitch.com/remix/#!/archive-stumbler">remix it on glitch</a>.
